## Abstract

Aggressive and hate-filled messages are prevalent on the internet more than ever. These messages are being targeted against a person or an event online and making the internet a
more hostile environment. Since this issue is
widespread across many users and is not only
limited to one language, there is a need for
automated models with multilingual capabilities to detect such hostile messages on the online platform. In this paper, the performance
of our classifiers is described in the Shared
Task on Multilingual Gender Biased and Communal Language Identification at ICON 2021.
Our team “Beware Haters” took part in Hindi,
Bengali, Meitei, and Multilingual tasks. Our
team used various models like Random Forest,
Logistic Regression, Bidirectional Long Short
Term Memory, and an ensemble model. Model
interpretation tool LIME was used before integrating the models. The instance F1 score
of our best performing models for Hindi, Bengali, Meitei, and Multilingual tasks are 0.289,
0.292, 0.322, 0.294 respectively.
